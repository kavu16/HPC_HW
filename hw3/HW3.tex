All reports from the Apple M1 chip
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In general, each $\mathrm{for}$ loop would take about $O(n^2)$ time to 
execute.  With multiple threads, this time will be divided amongst $t$ threads, so we 
have $n^2/t$.  However the second $\mathrm{for}$ loop has to wait for the first one to 
finish, and so we have $2*n^2/t$ for the total time where about half of that time will 
be waiting.

        \item The static modifier splits the for loop into chunks of the specified size 
and then those are assigned in order to different threads.  This should result in about 
the same theoretical execution time since you still have the same number of threads 
running in parallel.

        \item The dynamic modifier works by assigning iteration chunks to any free 
thread.  The way these are assigned is non-deterministic, however you can see some 
speed up, e.g., if a thread gets assigned long chunks, many short chunks could be 
assigned to other threads while it is executing.

        \item Yes, the $\mathrm{nowait}$ clause allows us to continue execution without 
waiting for the previous threads to resolve.  This would cut our exectution in half 
because half the time spent above was in waiting.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item In parallelizing my omp-scan code, I got some strange results where I would 
get large errors even though my final sum was the same.  I think my code should be 
correct, where i parallelize, put the offsets into a shared vector, then update in 
parallel based on where we are in the iteration.  Perhaps the collapse clause isn't 
quite right, but the errors looked like datatype errors rather than arithmetic errors 
to me, so the final sum matching convinced me that in theory everything was right, just 
maybe missing something in the C++ code.  I also think there might be cache things 
going on where the sequential gets faster.  The following are timings for 1, 2, 3, and 
4 threads respectively, on my M1 chip with 4 available cores.

    \begin{verbatim}

./omp-scan
Final sum = 64818392
sequential-scan = 0.234070s

Final sum = 64818392

error = 80536748538462208
    \end{verbatim}

    \item The results looked like they were going to converge, though I'm not sure why 
they seem to get stuck in convergence for small numbers, perhaps this is just the 
slowness of these methods.  My Gauss-Seidel implentations did a little more poorly, I 
think the issue was in red-black ordering when trying to collapse the for loops in the 
#pragma. I tried to start the iterator based off of the other iterator, but i don't 
think openmp liked that, so i had to just collapse the outer loop.  Here are the 
timings for the M1 chip with 4 processors, 5000 iterations, and N=10, 100, 1000.
